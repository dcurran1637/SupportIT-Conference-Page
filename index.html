        <h3>Please Use Coasters</h3>
        <p>
            We're fairly sure you've noticed the table. Our Directors made it with their bare hands,  
            and they're just a little proud of it. It has a few blemishes already from the mistakes  
            made during its creation, but we'd prefer not to add to them.  
            <strong>Please use coasters.</strong>
